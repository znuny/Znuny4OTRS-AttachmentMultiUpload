# Functionality

In the standard OTRS it's only possible to upload attachments one after another, but not to upload multiple attachments at once. This package extends the Standard OTRS that it can handle the upload of multiple attachments at once. This functionality requires a modern browser at the client side that supports the HTML5 attribute 'multiple'.

After this package is installed the functionality can be used immediately in the agent and customer interface.
